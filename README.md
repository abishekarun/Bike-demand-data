## Bike Demand Dataset

In this project, we try to work on [bike demand data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data) competition posted on kaggle. We have also explored plotly and graphviz libraries extensively for plotting and visualization. 

The Jupyter Notebook file is [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abishekarun/Bike-demand-data/blob/master/bike_sharing.ipynb) for this project.

The resources that helped me are:

+ [Plotly documentation](https://plot.ly/python/)
+ [Graphviz Documentation](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/graphviz/latest/graphviz.pdf)
